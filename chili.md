## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 pounds ground beef
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 can lager
- 1 7-ounce can chipotle chiles in adobo, finely chopped
- 4 fresh jalapeños, finely chopped
- 2 15-ounce cans kidney beans
- 2 15-ounce cans pinto beans
- 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar

## Preparation

### Step 1

Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven on medium-high. Season ground beef with salt and pepper. Brown the meat in batches, and transfer to a plate.

### Step 2

Reduce heat to medium, and add in onions and garlic. Cook until onions are translucent, scraping up the bits of browned meat from the bottom of the pot, around 6-8 minutes.

### Step 3

Stir in cumin and oregano, and allow to cook for 1 minute.

### Step 4

Stir in tomatoes and brown sugar, scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen spices. Add the lager, and bring to a simmer. Allow to reduce until lager is almost completely evaporated, 10-15 minutes.

### Step 5

Add jalapeños, chipotles, ground beef, beans, and 4 cups of water to pot; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered until liquid is thickened, 1–2 hours. 

### Step 6

Remove from heat and stir in vinegar. Serve with sour cream, grated cheese, and cornbread.
