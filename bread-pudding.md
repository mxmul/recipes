## Ingredients
- 2 cups half & half (or 1 cup milk + 1 cup heavy cream)
- 3 eggs
- 6 ounces bread (brioche, challah, or King's Hawaiian rolls)
- 1/4 cup sugar
- Cinnamon, nutmeg, and bourbon to taste.

## Preparation

### Step 1

Cut or tear bread into 1" rough chunks, and place into a buttered 9x9 baking dish.

### Step 2

Whisk cream, eggs, and sugar together in a medium mixing bowl. Add a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, and a swig of bourbon.

### Step 3

Pour custard on bread, and let it sit for 5-10 minutes to absorb the liquid.

### Step 4

Bake until custard is set, and the top is lightly brown.

Serve with whipped cream.
